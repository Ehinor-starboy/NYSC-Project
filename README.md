# NYSC Data Analysis Project

## 1.0 Project Overview
This project comprises a multi-dashboard Power BI report that delivers a comprehensive analysis of the **National Youth Service Corps (NYSC)** program from the perspective of the Corps Members (CMs).  
The analysis is based on survey data from **108 Corps Members (55 Male, 53 Female)** with an average age of **25 years**.

The dashboards move beyond basic demographics to explore the relationship between deployment, Place of Primary Assignment (PPA) experience, and the overall perception of the NYSC program.  
Key insights include:  

- **Job Relevance and Satisfaction**  
- **Compensation and Accommodation**  
- **Skill Development**  
- **Deployment Statistics**  
- **Perceived Program Value**  
- **Post-Service Plans**

## 3.0 Integrated Observations & Insights

### 3.1 The Compensation and Retention Crisis
- **Finding:** 60% of CMs receive either *No Compensation* (29 CMs) or *Very Low Income* (36 CMs).  
- **Impact:** This financial strain drives **69% of CMs** to reject staying at their PPA post-service.  

### 3.2 The Skill Development Gap
- **Finding:** Many CMs, especially females, report learning **no new skill** during service.  
- **Impact:** This undermines the program’s stated empowerment goals.  

### 3.3 The Paradox of Relevance vs. Value
- **Finding:** Although **51.85%** find their PPA relevant, **62.04%** rate the NYSC program as *neutral or not valuable*.  
- **Analysis:** Relevance alone doesn’t translate to value; skill-building and compensation matter more.  

### 3.4 Deployment Success vs. Accommodation Burden
- **Finding:** Many CMs are deployed to different states (achieving national integration).  
- **Challenge:** Most rely on **self-arranged housing**, adding financial burden.

## 4.0 Conclusion & Key Takeaways
- **Strengths:** Effective national deployment and academic relevance for many CMs.  
- **Weaknesses:** Lack of structured skill development and low compensation undermine program impact.  
- **Recommendations:**  
  - Policy review on **PPA compensation**  
  - Structured **training & skills programs** in key sectors  
  - Improved **support systems for accommodation**
